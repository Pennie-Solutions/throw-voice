### Not a developer? Not a problem!
This is a standalone version of pawa, meaning no database or complicated setup. One launcher, one configuration file and you're off to the races!
Run Pawa Lite wherever you want, whenever you want, and on your own terms. Store your meetings, podcasts, or creative project on your computer, it's YOUR data.

?> _Limited run for early adopters, so it's **HEAVILY** discounted._
